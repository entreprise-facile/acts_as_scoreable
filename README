ActsAsScoreable
===============

This is a simple plugin to add score to a model. I'm lame in english, so look at the example.

Example
=======

app/models/YourModel.rb :

	acts_as_scoreable
	
or, if you want to use a custom score field :
	
	acts_as_scoreable :acts_as_scoreable_text_field => :points
	
then you can do :

YourModel.score #it will return the current score if the score field is "score", if it's "point", just do YourModel.points
YourModel.score_up #it will score_up your score (no matters the score field)
YourModel.score_down #it will score_down your score (no matters the score field)
YourModel.score=4 #it will define the current score to 4 (no matters the score field)

You can also use this helper :

<%= vote(item.id) %> to display the vote arrows
